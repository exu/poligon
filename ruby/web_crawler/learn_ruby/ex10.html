<h1>Exercise 10: What Was That?<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-10-what-was-that" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>In Exercise 9 I threw you some new stuff, just to keep you on your toes.
I showed you two ways to make a string that goes across multiple lines.
In the first way, I put the characters <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">\n</span></tt> (back-slash n) between the
names of the months. What these two characters do is put a new line
character into the string at that point.</p>
<p>This use of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">\</span></tt> (back-slash) character is a way we can put
difficult-to-type characters into a string. There are plenty of these
"escape sequences" available for different characters you might want to
put in, but there's a special one, the double back-slash which is just
two of them <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">\\</span></tt>. These two characters will print just one back-slash.
We'll try a few of these sequences so you can see what I mean.</p>
<p>Another important escape sequence is to escape a single-quote <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'</span></tt> or
double-quote <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"</span></tt>. Imagine you have a string that uses double-quotes
and you want to put a double-quote in for the output. If you do this
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"I</span> <span class="pre">"understand"</span> <span class="pre">joe."</span></tt> then Ruby will get confused since it will
think the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"</span></tt> around <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"understand"</span></tt> actually ends the string. You
need a way to tell Ruby that the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"</span></tt> inside the string isn't a real
double-quote.</p>
<p>To solve this problem you escape double-quotes and single-quotes so Ruby
knows to include in the string. Here's an example:</p>
<div class="highlight-ruby">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="s2">"I am 6'2</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2"> tall."</span>  <span class="c1"># escape double-quote inside string</span>
<span class="s1">'I am 6\'2" tall.'</span>  <span class="c1"># escape single-quote inside string</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The second way is by using here document syntax, which uses <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;NAME</span></tt>
and works like a string, but you also can put as many lines of text you
as want until you type <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">NAME</span></tt> again. We'll also play with these.</p>
