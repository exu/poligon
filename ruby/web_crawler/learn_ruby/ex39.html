<h1>Exercise 39: Doing Things To Arrays<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-39-doing-things-to-arrays" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>You have learned about arrays. When you learned about <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">while-loops</span></tt>
you "pushed" numbers onto the end of an array and printed them out.
There was also extra credit where you were supposed to find all the
other things you can do to arrays in the Ruby documentation. That was a
while back, so go find in the book where you did that and review if you
do not know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Found it? Remember it? Good. When you did this you had a list, and you
"called" the function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">push</span></tt> on it. However, you may not really
understand what's going on so let's see what we can do to lists, and how
doing things with "on" them works.</p>
<p>When you type Ruby code that reads <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mystuff.push('hello')</span></tt> you are
actually setting off a chain of events inside Ruby to cause something to
happen to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mystuff</span></tt> array. Here's how it works:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Ruby sees you mentioned <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mystuff</span></tt> and looks up that variable. It
might have to look backwards to see if you created with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></tt>, look
and see if it is a function argument, or maybe it's a global
variable. Either way it has to find the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mystuff</span></tt> array first.</li>
<li>Once it finds <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mystuff</span></tt> it then hits the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.</span></tt> (period) operator
and starts to look at variables that are a part of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mystuff</span></tt>. Since
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mystuff</span></tt> is an array, it knows that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mystuff</span></tt> has a bunch of
functions.</li>
<li>It then hits <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">push</span></tt> and compares the name "push" to all the ones
that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mystuff</span></tt> says it responds to. If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">push</span></tt> is in there (it is)
then it grabs that to use.</li>
<li>Next Ruby sees the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(</span></tt> (parenthesis) and realizes, "Oh hey, this
should be a function." At this point it calls (aka runs, executes)
the function.</li>
</ol>
<p>That might be a lot to take in, but we're going to spend a few exercises
getting this concept firm in your brain. To kick things off, here's an
exercise that mixes strings and lists for all kinds of fun.</p>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Go read about "Object Oriented Programming" online. Confused? Yeah I
was too. Do not worry. You will learn enough to be dangerous, and you
can slowly learn more later. Read up on what a "class" is in Ruby.
<em>Do not read about how other languages use the word "class".</em> That
will only mess you up.</li>
<li>What's the relationship between <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">something.methods</span></tt> and the "class"
of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">something</span></tt>?</li>
<li>If you do not have any idea what I'm talking about do not worry.
Programmers like to feel smart so they invented Object Oriented
Programming, named it OOP, and then used it way too much. If you
think that's hard, you should try to use "functional programming".</li>
