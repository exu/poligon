<h1>Exercise 45: Is-A, Has-A, Objects, and Classes<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-45-is-a-has-a-objects-and-classes" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a>
</h1>
<p>An important concept that you have to understand is the difference
between a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Class</span></tt> and an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Object</span></tt>. The problem is, there is no real
"difference" between a class and an object. They are actually the same
thing at different points in time. I will demonstrate by a Zen koan:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">What</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">difference</span> <span class="pre">between</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">Fish</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">Salmon?</span></tt></p>
<p>Did that question sort of confuse you? Really sit down and think about
it for a minute. I mean, a Fish and a Salmon are different but, wait,
they are the same thing right? A Salmon is a kind of Fish, so I mean
it's not different. But at the same time, becase a Salmon is a
particular type of Fish and so it's actually different from all other
Fish. That's what makes it a Salmon and not a Halibut. So a Salmon and a
Fish are the same but different. Weird.</p>
<p>This question is confusing because most people do not think about real
things this way, but they intuitively understand them. You do not need
to think about the difference between a Fish and a Salmon because you
know how they are related. You know a Salmon is a kind of Fish and that
there are other kinds of Fish without having to understand that.</p>
<p>Let's take it one step further, let's say you have a bucket full of 3
Salmon and because you are a nice person, you have decided to name them
Frank, Joe, and Mary. Now, think about this question:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">What</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">difference</span> <span class="pre">between</span> <span class="pre">Mary</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">Salmon?</span></tt></p>
<p>Again this is a weird question, but it's a bit easier than the Fish vs.
Salmon question. You know that Mary is a Salmon, and so she's not really
different. She's just a specific "instance" of a Salmon. Joe and Frank
are also instances of Salmon. But, what do I mean when I say instance? I
mean they were created from some other Salmon and now represent a real
thing that has Salmon-like attributes.</p>
<p>Now for the mind bending idea: Fish is a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Class</span></tt>, and Salmon is a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Class</span></tt>, and Mary is an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Object</span></tt>. Think about that for a second.
Alright let's break it down real slow and see if you get it.</p>
<p>A Fish is a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Class</span></tt>, meaning it's not a real thing, but rather a word
we attach to instances of things with similar attributes. Got fins? Got
gills? Lives in water? Alright it's probably a Fish.</p>
<p>Someone with a Ph.D. then comes along and says, "No my young friend,
this Fish is actually Salmo salar, affectionately known as a Salmon."
This professor has just clarified the Fish further and made a new
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Class</span></tt> called "Salmon" that has more specific attributes. Longer
nose, reddish flesh, big, lives in the ocean or fresh water, tasty? Ok,
probably a Salmon.</p>
<p>Finally, a cook comes along and tells the Ph.D., "No, you see this
Salmon right here, I'll call her Mary and I'm going to make a tasty
fillet out of her with a nice sauce." Now you have this instance of a
Salmon (which also is an instance of a Fish) named Mary turned into
something real that is filling your belly. It has become an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Object</span></tt>.</p>
<p>There you have it: Mary is a kind of Salmon that is a kind of Fish.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Object</span></tt> is a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Class</span></tt> is a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Class</span></tt>.</p>
<p>How This Looks In Code This is a weird concept, but to be very honest
you only have to worry about it when you make new classes, and when you
use a class. I will show you two tricks to help you figure out whether
something is a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Class</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Object</span></tt>.</p>
<p>First, you need to learn two catch phrases "is-a" and "has-a". You use
the phrase is-a when you talk about objects and classes being related to
each other by a class relationship. You use has-a when you talk about
objects and classes that are related only because they reference each
other.</p>
<p>Now, go through this piece of code and replace each <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">##??</span></tt> comment
with a replacement comment that says whether the next line represents an
is-a or a has-a relationship, and what that relationship is. In the
beginning of the code, I've laid out a few examples, so you just have to
write the remaining ones.</p>
<p>Remember, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">is-a</span></tt> is the relationship between Fish and Salmon, while
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">has-a</span></tt> is the relationship between Salmon and Gills.</p>
