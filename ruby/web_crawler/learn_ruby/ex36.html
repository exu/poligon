<h1>Exercise 36: Designing and Debugging<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-36-designing-and-debugging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>Now that you know <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statements</span></tt>, I'm going to give you some rules
for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for-loops</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">while-loops</span></tt> that will keep you out of trouble.
I'm also going to give you some tips on debugging so that you can figure
out problems with your program. Finally, you are going to design a
similar little game as in the last exercise but with a slight twist.</p>
<div class="section" id="rules-for-if-statements">
<h2>Rules For If-Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#rules-for-if-statements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Every <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statement</span></tt> must have an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">else</span></tt>.</li>
<li>If this <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">else</span></tt> should never be run because it doesn't make sense,
then you must use a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">die</span></tt> function in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">else</span></tt> that prints out
an error message and dies, just like we did in the last exercise.
This will find many errors.</li>
<li>Never nest <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statements</span></tt> more than 2 deep and always try to do
them 1 deep. This means if you put an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></tt> in an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></tt> then you
should be looking to move that second <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></tt> into another function.</li>
<li>Treat <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statements</span></tt> like paragraphs, where each
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></tt>,``elsif``,``else`` grouping is like a set of sentences. Put
blank lines before and after.</li>
<li>Your boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their
calculations to variables earlier in your function and use a good
name for the variable.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you follow these simple rules, you will start writing better code
than most programmers. Go back to the last exercise and see if I
followed all of these rules. If not, fix it.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Never be a slave to the rules in real life. For
training purposes you need to follow these rules to make your mind
strong, but in real life sometimes these rules are just stupid. If
you think a rule is stupid, try not using it.</p>

<div class="section" id="rules-for-loops">
<h2>Rules For Loops<a class="headerlink" href="#rules-for-loops" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Use a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">while-loop</span></tt> only to loop forever, and that means probably
never. This only applies to Ruby, other languages are different.</li>
<li>Use a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for-loop</span></tt> for all other kinds of looping, especially if
there is a fixed or limited number of things to loop over.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips For Debugging<a class="headerlink" href="#tips-for-debugging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Do not use a "debugger". A debugger is like doing a full-body scan on
a sick person. You do not get any specific useful information, and
you find a whole lot of information that doesn't help and is just
confusing.</li>
<li>The best way to debug a program is to use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">puts</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">p</span></tt> to print
out the values of variables at points in the program to see where
they go wrong.</li>
<li>Make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them. Do not
write massive files of code before you try to run them. Code a
little, run a little, fix a little.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now write a similar game to the one that I created in the last exercise.
It can be any kind of game you want in the same flavor. Spend a week on
it making it as interesting as possible. For extra credit, use arrays,
functions, and modules (remember those from Ex. 13?) as much as
possible, and find as many new pieces of Ruby as you can to make the
game work.</p>
<p>There is one catch though, write up your idea for the game first. Before
you start coding you must write up a map for your game. Create the
rooms, monsters, and traps that the player must go through on paper
before you code.</p>
<p>Once you have your map, try to code it up. If you find problems with the
map then adjust it and make the code match.</p>
<p>One final word of advice: Every programmer becomes paralyzed by
irrational fear starting a new large project. They then use
procrastination to avoid confronting this fear and end up not getting
their program working or even started. I do this. Everyone does this.
The best way to avoid this is to make a list of things you should do,
and then do them one at a time.</p>
<p>Just start doing it, do a small version, make it bigger, keep a list of
things to do, and do them.</p>
