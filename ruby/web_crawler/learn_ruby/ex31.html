<h1>Exercise 31: Making Decisions<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-31-making-decisions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>In the first half of this book you mostly just printed out things and
called functions, but everything was basically in a straight line. Your
scripts ran starting at the top, and went to the bottom where they
ended. If you made a function you could run that function later, but it
still didn't have the kind of branching you need to really make
decisions. Now that you have <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">else</span></tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">elsif</span></tt> you can
start to make scripts that decide things.</p>
<p>In the last script you wrote out a simple set of tests asking some
questions. In this script you will ask the user questions and make
decisions based on their answers. Write this script, and then play with
it quite a lot to figure it out.</p>

<p>A key point here is that you are now putting the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statements</span></tt>
<em>inside</em> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statements</span></tt> as code that can run. This is very powerful
and can be used to create "nested" decisions, where one branch leads to
another and another.</p>
<p>Make sure you understand this concept of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statements</span></tt> inside
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statements</span></tt>. In fact, do the extra credit to really nail it.</p>
