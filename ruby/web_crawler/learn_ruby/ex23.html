<h1>Exercise 23: Read Some Code<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-23-read-some-code" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a>
</h1>
<p>You should have spent last week getting your list of symbols straight
and locked in your mind. Now you get to apply this to another week
reading code on the internet. This exercise will be daunting at first.
I'm going to throw you in the deep end for a few days and have you just
try your best to read and understand some source code from real
projects. The goal isn't to get you to understand code, but to teach you
the following three skills:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Finding Ruby source code for things you need.</li>
<li>Reading through the code and looking for files.</li>
<li>Trying to understand code you find.</li>
<li>At your level you really do not have the skills to evaluate the
things you find, but you can benefit from getting exposure and seeing
how things look.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you do this exercise, think of yourself as an anthropologist,
trucking through a new land with just barely enough of the local
language to get around and survive. Except, of course, that you will
actually get out alive because the internet isn't a jungle. Anyway.</p>
<p>Here's what you do:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Go to github.com with your favorite web browser and search for
"ruby".</li>
<li>Pick a random project and click on it.</li>
<li>Click on the Source tab and browse through the list of files and
directories until you find a .rb file.</li>
<li>Start at the top and read through it, taking notes on what you think
it does.</li>
<li>If any symbols or strange words seem to interest you, write them down
to research later.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. Your job is to use what you know so far and see if you can
read the code and get a grasp of what it does. Try skimming the code
first, and then read it in detail. Maybe also try taking very difficult
parts and reading each symbol you know outloud.</p>
<p>Now try several other sites:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>heroku.com</li>
<li>rubygems.org</li>
<li>bitbucket.org</li>
</ul>
<p>On each of these sites you may find weird files ending in .c so stick to
.rb files like the ones you have written in this book.</p>
<p>A final fun thing to do is use the above four sources of Ruby code and
type in topics you are interested in instead of "ruby". Search for
"journalism", "cooking", "physics", or anything you are curious about.
Chances are there's some code out there you could use right away.</p>
