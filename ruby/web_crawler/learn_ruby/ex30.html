<h1>Exercise 30: Else And If<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-30-else-and-if" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>In the last exercise you worked out some <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statements</span></tt>, and then
tried to guess what they are and how they work. Before you learn more
I'll explain what everything is by answering the questions you had from
extra credit. You did the extra credit right?</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>What do you think the if does to the code under it? An <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></tt>
statement creates what is called a "branch" in the code. It's kind of
like those choose your own adventure books where you are asked to
turn to one page if you make one choice, and another if you go a
different direction. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statement</span></tt> tells your script, "If this
boolean expression is True, then run the code under it, otherwise
skip it."</li>
<li>Can you put other boolean expressions from Ex. 27 in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></tt>
statement? Try it. Yes you can, and they can be as complex as you
like, although really complex things generally are bad style.</li>
<li>What happens if you change the initial variables for people, cats,
and dogs? Because you are comparing numbers, if you change the
numbers, different <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statements</span></tt> will evaluate to <strong>True</strong> and
the blocks of code under them will run. Go back and put different
numbers in and see if you can figure out in your head what blocks of
code will run.</li>
</ol>
<p>Compare my answers to your answers, and make sure you really understand
the concept of a "block" of code. This is important for when you do the
next exercise where you write all the parts of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statements</span></tt> that
you can use.</p>
<p>Type this one in and make it work too.</p>
