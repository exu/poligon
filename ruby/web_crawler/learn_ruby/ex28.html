<h1>Exercise 28: Boolean Practice<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-28-boolean-practice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>The logic combinations you learned from the last exercise are called
"boolean" logic expressions. Boolean logic is used everywhere in
programming. They are essential fundamental parts of computation and
knowing them very well is akin to knowing your scales in music.</p>
<p>In this exercise you will be taking the logic exercises you memorized
and start trying them out in IRB. Take each of these logic problems, and
write out what you think the answer will be. In each case it will be
either true or false. Once you have the answers written down, you will
start IRB in your terminal and type them in to confirm your answers.</p>
<div class="highlight-python">
<pre>1. true and true
2. false and true
3. 1 == 1 and 2 == 1
4. "test" == "test"
5. 1 == 1 or 2 != 1
6. true and 1 == 1
7. false and 0 != 0
8. true or 1 == 1
9. "test" == "testing"
10. 1 != 0 and 2 == 1
11. "test" != "testing"
12. "test" == 1
13. not (true and false)
14. not (1 == 1 and 0 != 1)
15. not (10 == 1 or 1000 == 1000)
16. not (1 != 10 or 3 == 4)
17. not ("testing" == "testing" and "Zed" == "Cool Guy")
18. 1 == 1 and not ("testing" == 1 or 1 == 0)
19. "chunky" == "bacon" and not (3 == 4 or 3 == 3)
20. 3 == 3 and not ("testing" == "testing" or "Ruby" == "Fun")</pre>
</div>
<p>I will also give you a trick to help you figure out the more complicated
ones toward the end.</p>
<p>Whenever you see these boolean logic statements, you can solve them
easily by this simple process:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Find equality test (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">==</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">!=</span></tt>) and replace it with its truth.</li>
<li>Find each and/or inside a parenthesis and solve those first.</li>
<li>Find each not and invert it.</li>
<li>Find any remaining and/or and solve it.</li>
<li>When you are done you should have true or false.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will demonstrate with a variation on #20:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3</span> <span class="pre">!=</span> <span class="pre">4</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">("testing"</span> <span class="pre">!=</span> <span class="pre">"test"</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">"Ruby"</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">"Ruby")</span></tt></p>
<p>Here's me going through each of the steps and showing you the
translation until I've boiled it down to a single result:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Solve each equality test:<ul>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3</span> <span class="pre">!=</span> <span class="pre">4</span></tt> is <strong>True</strong>:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">true</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">("testing"</span> <span class="pre">!=</span> <span class="pre">"test"</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">"Ruby"</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">"Ruby")</span></tt>
</li>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"testing"</span> <span class="pre">!=</span> <span class="pre">"test"</span></tt> is <strong>True</strong>:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">true</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">(true</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">"Ruby"</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">"Ruby")</span></tt>
</li>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"Ruby"</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">"Ruby"</span></tt>: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">true</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">(true</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">true)</span></tt>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Find each and/or in parenthesis <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">()</span></tt>:<ul>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(true</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">true)</span></tt> is <strong>True</strong>: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">true</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">(true)</span></tt> 3 Find
each not and invert it:</li>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">(true)</span></tt> is <strong>False</strong>: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">true</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">false</span></tt>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Find any remaining and/or and solve them:<ul>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">true</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">false</span></tt> is <strong>False</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With that we're done and know the result is false.</p>

<p class="last">The more complicated ones may seem very hard at first.
You should be able to give a good first stab at solving them, but do
not get discouraged. I'm just getting you primed for more of these
"logic gymnastics" so that later cool stuff is much easier. Just
stick with it, and keep track of what you get wrong, but do not
worry that it's not getting in your head quite yet. It'll come.</p>

<h2>What You Should See<a class="headerlink" href="#what-you-should-see" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>

<p>After you have tried to guess at these, this is what your session with
IRB might look like:</p>
<div class="highlight-console">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> irb
<span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p180 :001 &gt; true and true</span>
<span class="go"> =&gt; true</span>
<span class="go">ruby-1.9.2-p180 :002 &gt; 1 == 1 and 2 == 2</span>

<div class="section" id="extra-credit">
<h2>Extra Credit<a class="headerlink" href="#extra-credit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>There are a lot of operators in Ruby similar to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">!=</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">==</span></tt>.
Try to find out as many "equality operators" as you can. They should
be like: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;=</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Write out the names of each of these equality operators. For example,
I call <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">!=</span></tt> "not equal".</li>
<li>Play with IRB by typing out new boolean operators, and before you hit
enter try to shout out what it is. Do not think about it, just the
first thing that comes to mind. Write it down then hit enter, and
keep track of how many you get right and wrong. Throw away that piece
of paper from #3 away so you do not accidentally try to use it later.</li>
