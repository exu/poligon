<h1>Exercise 7: More Printing<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-7-more-printing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>Now we are going to do a bunch of exercises where you just type code in
and make it run. I won't be explaining much since it is just more of the
same. The purpose is to build up your chops. See you in a few exercises,
and do not skip! Do not paste!</p>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.</li>
<li>Read each one backwards or out loud to find your errors.</li>
<li>From now on, when you make mistakes write down on a piece of paper
what kind of mistake you made.</li>
<li>When you go to the next exercise, look at the last mistakes you made
and try not to make them in this new one.</li>
<li>Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians
who like everyone to think they are perfect and never wrong, but it's
all an act. They make mistakes all the time.</li>
