<h1>Exercise 19: Functions And Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-19-functions-and-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>Functions may have been a mind-blowing amount of information, but do not
worry. Just keep doing these exercises and going through your checklist
from the last exercise and you will eventually get it.</p>
<p>There is one tiny point though that you might not have realized which
we'll reinforce right now: The variables in your function are not
connected to the variables in your script. Here's an exercise to get you
thinking about this:</p>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"And we can combine the two, variables and math:"</span>
<span class="n">cheese_and_crackers</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">amount_of_cheese</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">amount_of_crackers</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>This shows all different ways we're able to give our function
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cheese_and_crackers</span></tt> the values it needs to print them. We can give
it straight numbers. We can give it variables. We can give it math. We
can even combine math and variables.</p>
<p>In a way, the arguments to a function are kind of like our <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></tt>
character when we make a variable. In fact, if you can use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></tt> to name
something, you can usually pass it to a function as an argument.</p>
