<h1>Exercise 1: A Good First Program<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-1-a-good-first-program" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>Remember, you should have spent a good amount of time in Exercise 0
learning how to install a text editor, run the text editor, run the
Terminal, and work with both of them. If you haven't done that then do
not go on. You will not have a good time. This is the only time I'll
start an exercise with a warning that you should not skip or get ahead
of yourself.</p>

<p>Type the above into a single file named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ex1.rb</span></tt>. This is important as
Ruby works best with files ending in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.rb</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Then in Terminal run the file by typing:</p>
<div class="highlight-console">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">ruby ex1.rb</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you did it right then you should see the same output I have below. If
not, you have done something wrong. No, the computer is not wrong.</p>

<p>You may see the name of your directory before the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$</span></tt> which is fine,
but if your output is not exactly the same, find out why and fix it.</p>
<p>If you have an error it will look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-console">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">ruby ex1.rb</span>
<span class="go">ex1.rb:4: syntax error, unexpected tCONSTANT, expecting $end</span>
<span class="go">puts "This is fun."</span>
<span class="go">          ^</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It's important that you can read these since you will be making many of
these mistakes. Even I make many of these mistakes. Let's look at this
line-by-line.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Here we ran our command in the terminal to run the ex1.rb script.</li>
<li>Ruby then tells us that the file ex1.rb has an error on line 4.</li>
<li>It then prints this line for us.</li>
<li>Then it puts a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">^</span></tt> (caret) character to point at where the problem
is.</li>
<li>Finally, it prints out a "syntax error" and tells us something about
what might be the error. Usually these are very cryptic, but if you
copy that text into a search engine, you will find someone else who's
had that error and you can probably figure out how to fix it.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="extra-credit">
<h2>Extra Credit<a class="headerlink" href="#extra-credit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>You will also have Extra Credit. The Extra Credit contains things you
should try to do. If you can't, skip it and come back later.</p>
<p>For this exercise, try these things:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Make your script print another line.</li>
<li>Make your script print only one of the lines.</li>
<li>Put a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></tt> (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What
did it do? Try to find out what this character does.</li>
<li>From now on, I won't explain how each exercise works unless an
exercise is different.</li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">An 'octothorpe' is also called a 'pound', 'hash', 'mesh',
or any number of names. Pick the one that makes you chill out.</p>
