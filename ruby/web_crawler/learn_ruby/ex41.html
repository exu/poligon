<h1>Exercise 41: Gothons From Planet Percal #25<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-41-gothons-from-planet-percal-25" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>Did you figure out the secret of the method in the hash from the last
exercise? Can you explain it to yourself? I'll explain it and you can
compare your explanation with mine. Here are the lines of code we are
talking about:</p>
<div class="highlight-ruby">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">cities</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:find</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">method</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:find</span><span class="p">\</span><span class="n">_city</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">cities</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:find</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="n">call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cities</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">state</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Remember that code can be stored in variables too. In order to store a
block of code in a variable, we create something called a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">proc</span></tt>,
which is short for procedure. In this code, first we are calling Ruby's
built-in method called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">method</span></tt>, which returns a proc version of the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">find_city</span></tt> method, which we then store in the hash <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cities</span></tt> with
the key <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">:find</span></tt>. This is the same as all the others where we set
states to some cities, but in this case it's actually the proc.</p>
<p>Alright, so once we know that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">find_city</span></tt> is in the hash at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">:find</span></tt>,
that means we can do work with it. The 2nd line of code (used later in
the previous exercise) can be broken down like this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Ruby reads <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cities</span></tt> and finds that variable, it's a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hash</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Then there's <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[:find]</span></tt> which will index into the cities hash and
pull out whatever is at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">:find</span></tt>.</li>
<li>What is at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[:find]</span></tt> is our proc <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">find_city</span></tt> so Ruby then knows
it's got a proc, and when it hits <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.call</span></tt> it calls the proc code.</li>
<li>The parameters <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cities</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">state</span></tt> are passed to the proc
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">find_city</span></tt>, and it runs because it's called.</li>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">find_city</span></tt> then tries to look up <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">states</span></tt> inside <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cities</span></tt>, and
returns what it finds or a message saying it didn't find anything.</li>
<li>Ruby takes what <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">find_city</span></tt> returned, and prints it out using the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">puts</span></tt> method we've been using all along.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a trick. Sometimes these things read better in English if you
read the code backwards. This is how I would do it for that same line
(remember backwards):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">state</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">city</span></tt> are...</li>
<li>passed as parameters to...</li>
<li>a proc at...</li>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">:find</span></tt> inside...</li>
<li>the hash <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cities</span></tt>...</li>
<li>and finally printed on the screen</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's another way to read it, this time "inside-out".</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Find the center item of the expression, in this case <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[:find]</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Go counter-clock-wise and you have a hash <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cities</span></tt>, so this finds
the element <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">:find</span></tt> in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cities</span></tt>.</li>
<li>That gives us a proc. Keep going counter-clock-wise and you get to
the parameters.</li>
<li>The parameters are passed to the proc, and that returns a result. Go
counter-clock-wise again.</li>
<li>Finally, we are at the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">puts</span></tt> statement, and we have our end
result.</li>
</ol>
<p>After decades of programming I don't even think about these three ways
to read code. I just glance at it and know what it means. I can even
glance at a whole screen of code, and all the bugs and errors jump out
at me. That took an incredibly long time and quite a bit more study than
is sane. To get that way, I learned these three ways of reading most any
programming language:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Front to back.</li>
<li>Back to front.</li>
<li>Counter-clock-wise.</li>
</ol>
<p>Try them out when you have a difficult statement to figure out.</p>
<p>Now type in your next exercise, then go over it. This one is gonna be
fun.</p>

<span class="go">--------</span>
<span class="go">You do a dive roll into the Weapon Armory, crouch and scan the room</span>
<span class="go">for more Gothons that might be hiding.  It's dead quiet, too quiet.</span>
<span class="go">You stand up and run to the far side of the room and find the</span>
<span class="go">neutron bomb in its container.  There's a keypad lock on the box</span>
<span class="go">and you need the code to get the bomb out.  If you get the code</span>
<span class="go">wrong 10 times then the lock closes forever and you can't</span>
<span class="go">get the bomb.  The code is 3 digits.</span>

<li>Explain how returning the next room works.</li>
<li>Add cheat codes to the game so you can get past the more difficult

<li>Instead of having each function print itself, learn about "here

<li>Write the room description as here document strings, and change the
runner to use them.</li>
<li>Once you have here document strings as the room description, do you
need to have the function prompt even? Have the runner prompt the
user, and pass that in to each function. Your functions should just
be <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statements</span></tt> printing the result and returning the next room.</li>
<li>This is actually a small version of something called a "finite state
