<h1>Exercise 13: Parameters, Unpacking, Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-13-parameters-unpacking-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>In this exercise we will cover one more input method you can use to pass
variables to a script (script being another name for your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.rb</span></tt>
files). You know how you type <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ruby</span> <span class="pre">ex13.rb</span></tt> to run the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ex13.rb</span></tt>
file? Well the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ex13.rb</span></tt> part of the command is called an "argument".
What we'll do now is write a script that also accepts arguments.</p>
<p>Type this program and I'll explain it in detail:</p>
<div class="highlight-ruby"><table class="highlighttable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3

6</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">first</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">second</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">third</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">ARGV</span> 

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"The script is called: </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="vg">$0</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Your first variable is: </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">first</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Your second variable is: </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">second</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Your third variable is: </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">third</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ARGV</span></tt> is the "argument variable", a very standard name in
programming, that you will find used in many other languages. It's in
all caps because it's a constant, meaning you shouldn't change the value
once it's been assigned. This variable holds the arguments you pass to
your Ruby script when you run it. In the exercises you will get to play
with this more and see what happens.</p>
<p>Line 1 "unpacks" <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ARGV</span></tt> so that, rather than holding all the
arguments, it gets assigned to three variables you can work with:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">first</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">second</span></tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">third</span></tt>. The name of the script itself is
stored in a special variable <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$0</span></tt>, which we don't need to unpack. This
may look strange, but "unpack" is probably the best word to describe
what it does. It just says, "Take whatever is in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ARGV</span></tt>, unpack it,
and assign it to all of these variables on the left in order."</p>
<p>After that we just print them out like normal.</p>

<p>Run the program like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-console">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">ruby ex13.rb first 2nd 3rd</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is what you should see when you do a few different runs with
different arguments:</p>
<div class="highlight-console">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> ruby ex13.rb first 2nd 3rd
<span class="go">The script is called: ex13.rb</span>
<span class="go">Your first variable is: first</span>
<span class="go">Your second variable is: 2nd</span>
<span class="go">Your third variable is: 3rd</span>

<span class="gp">$</span> ruby ex13.rb cheese apples bread
<span class="go">The script is called: ex13.rb</span>
<span class="go">Your first variable is: cheese</span>
<span class="go">Your second variable is: apples</span>
<span class="go">Your third variable is: bread</span>

<span class="gp">$</span> ruby ex13.rb Zed A. Shaw
<span class="go">The script is called: ex13.rb</span>
<span class="go">Your first variable is: Zed</span>
<span class="go">Your second variable is: A.</span>
<span class="go">Your third variable is: Shaw</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can actually replace "first", "2nd", and "3rd" with any three
things. You do not have to give these parameters either, you can give
any 3 strings you want:</p>
<div class="highlight-console">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">ruby ex13.rb stuff I like</span>
<span class="go">ruby ex13.rb anything 6 7</span>
</pre></div>
