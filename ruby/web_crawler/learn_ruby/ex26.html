<h1>Exercise 26: Congratulations, Take A Test!<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-26-congratulations-take-a-test" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a>
</h1>
<p>You are almost done with the first half of the book. The second half is
where things get interesting. You will learn logic and be able to do
useful things like make decisions.</p>
<p>Before you continue, I have a quiz for you. This quiz will be very hard
because it requires you to fix someone else's code. When you are a
programmer you often have to deal with another programmer's code, and
also with their arrogance. They will very frequently claim that their
code is perfect.</p>
<p>These programmers are stupid people who care little for others. A good
programmer assumes, like a good scientist, that there's always some
probability their code is wrong. Good programmers start from the premise
that their software is broken and then work to rule out all possible
ways it could be wrong before finally admitting that maybe it really is
the other guy's code.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will practice dealing with a bad programmer by
fixing a bad programmer's code. I have poorly copied exercises 24 and 25
into a file and removed random characters and added flaws. Most of the
errors are things Ruby will tell you, while some of them are math errors
you should find. Others are formatting errors or spelling mistakes in
the strings.</p>
<p>All of these errors are very common mistakes all programmers make. Even
experienced ones.</p>
<p>Your job in this exercise is to correct this file. Use all of your
skills to make this file better. Analyze it first, maybe printing it out
to edit it like you would a school term paper. Fix each flaw and keep
running it and fixing it until the script runs perfectly. Try not to get
help, and instead if you get stuck take a break and come back to it
later.</p>
<p>Even if this takes days to do, bust through it and make it right.</p>
<p>Finally, the point of this exercise isn't to type it in, but to fix an
existing file. To do that, you must go to:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/exercise26.txt">http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/exercise26.txt</a></p>
<p>Copy-paste the code into a file named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ex26.rb</span></tt>. This is the only time
you are allowed to copy-paste.</p>
