<h1>Exercise 4: Variables And Names<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-4-variables-and-names" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>Now you can print things with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">puts</span></tt> and you can do math. The next
step is to learn about variables. In programming a variable is nothing
more than a name for something so you can use the name rather than the
something as you code. Programmers use these variable names to make
their code read more like English, and because they have lousy memories.
If they didn't use good names for things in their software, they'd get
lost when they tried to read their code again.</p>
<p>If you get stuck with this exercise, remember the tricks you have been
taught so far of finding differences and focusing on details:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Write a comment above each line explaining to yourself what it does
in English.</li>
<li>Read your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.rb</span></tt> file backwards.</li>
<li>Read your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.rb</span></tt> file out loud saying even the characters.</li>

<p>When I wrote this program the first time I had a mistake, and Ruby told
me about it like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python">
<pre>ex4.rb:8:in `&lt;main&gt;': undefined local variable or method `car_pool_capacity' for main:Object (NameError)</pre>
</div>
<p>Explain this error in your own words. Make sure you use line numbers and
explain why.</p>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Explain why the 4.0 is used instead of just 4.</li>
<li>Remember that 4.0 is a "floating point" number. Find out what that
means.</li>
<li>Write comments above each of the variable assignments.</li>
<li>Make sure you know what <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></tt> is called (equals) and that it's making
names for things.</li>
<li>Remember <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_</span></tt> is an underscore character.</li>
<li>Try running IRB as a calculator like you did before and use variable
names to do your calculations. Popular variable names are also <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">i</span></tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">j</span></tt>.</li>
