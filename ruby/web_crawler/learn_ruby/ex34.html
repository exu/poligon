<h1>Exercise 34: Accessing Elements Of Arrays<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-34-accessing-elements-of-arrays" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>Arrays are pretty useful, but unless you can get at the things in them
they aren't all that great. You can already go through the elements of a
list in order, but what if you want say, the 5th element? You need to
know how to access the elements of an array. Here's how you would access
the first element of an array:</p>
<div class="highlight-ruby">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">animals</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">'bear'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'tiger'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'penguin'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'zebra'</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="n">bear</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">animals</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You take a list of
animals, and then you get the first one using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0</span></tt>?! How does that
work? Because of the way math works, Ruby start its lists at 0 rather
than 1. It seems weird, but there's many advantages to this, even though
it is mostly arbitrary.</p>
<p>The best way to explain why is by showing you the difference between how
you use numbers and how programmers use numbers.</p>
<p>Imagine you are watching the four animals in our array above
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">['bear',</span> <span class="pre">'tiger',</span> <span class="pre">'penguin',</span> <span class="pre">'zebra']</span></tt>) run in a race. They win in
the order we have them in this array. The race was really exciting
because the animals didn't eat each other and somehow managed to run a
race. Your friend, however, shows up late and wants to know who won.
Does your friend say, "Hey, who came in zeroth?" No, he says, "Hey, who
came in first?"</p>
<p>This is because the order of the animals is important. You can't have
the second animal without the first animal, and can't have the third
without the second. It's also impossible to have a "zeroth" animal since
zero means nothing. How can you have a nothing win a race? It just
doesn't make sense. We call these kinds of numbers "ordinal" numbers,
because they indicate an ordering of things.</p>
<p>Programmers, however, can't think this way because they can pick any
element out of a list at any point. To a programmer, the above list is
more like a deck of cards. If they want the tiger, they grab it. If they
want the zebra, they can take it too. This need to pull elements out of
lists at random means that they need a way to indicate elements
consistently by an address, or an "index", and the best way to do that
is to start the indices at 0. Trust me on this, the math is way easier
for these kinds of accesses. This kind of number is a "cardinal" number
and means you can pick at random, so there needs to be a 0 element.</p>
<p>So, how does this help you work with arrays? Simple, every time you say
to yourself, "I want the 3rd animal," you translate this "ordinal"
number to a "cardinal" number by subtracting 1. The "3rd" animal is at
index 2 and is the penguin. You have to do this because you have spent
your whole life using ordinal numbers, and now you have to think in
cardinal. Just subtract 1 and you will be good.</p>
<p>Remember: ordinal == ordered, 1st; cardinal == cards at random, 0.</p>
<p>Let's practice this. Take this list of animals, and follow the exercises
where I tell you to write down what animal you get for that ordinal or
cardinal number. Remember if I say "first", "second", etc. then I'm
using ordinal, so subtract 1. If I give you cardinal (0, 1, 2) then use
it directly.</p>
<div class="highlight-ruby">
<div class="highlight"><pre> <span class="n">animals</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">'bear'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'python'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'peacock'</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="s1">'kangaroo'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'whale'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'platypus'</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The animal at 1. The 3rd animal. The 1st animal. The animal at 3. The
5th animal. The animal at 2. The 6th animal. The animal at 4.</p>
<p>For each of these, write out a full sentence of the form: "The 1st
animal is at 0 and is a bear." Then say it backwards, "The animal at 0
is the 1st animal and is a bear."</p>
<p>Use your Ruby to check your answers.</p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Ruby has also a few convenience methods for accessing
particular elements in an array: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">animals.first</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">animals.last</span></tt></p>
