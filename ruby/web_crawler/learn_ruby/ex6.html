<h1>Exercise 6: Strings And Text<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-6-strings-and-text" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>While you have already been writing strings, you still do not know what
they do. In this exercise we create a bunch of variables with complex
strings so you can see what they are for. First an explanation of
strings.</p>
<p>A string is usually a bit of text you want to display to someone, or
"export" out of the program you are writing. Ruby knows you want
something to be a string when you put either <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"</span></tt> (double-quotes) or
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'</span></tt> (single-quotes) around the text. You saw this many times with your
use of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">puts</span></tt> when you put the text you want to go to the string
inside <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'</span></tt> after the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">puts</span></tt>. Then Ruby displays it.</p>
<p>Strings may contain the format characters you have discovered so far.
You simply put the formatted variables in the string, and then a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%</span></tt>
(percent) character, followed by the variable. The only catch is that if
you want multiple formats in your string to print multiple variables,
you need to put them inside <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[</span> <span class="pre">]</span></tt> (brackets) separated by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">,</span></tt>
(commas). It's as if you were telling me to buy you a list of items from
the store and you said, "I want milk, eggs, bread, and soup." Only as a
programmer we say, "[milk, eggs, bread, soup]".</p>
<p>Another way of injecting variables into your strings is to use something
called "string interpolation", which uses the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#{</span> <span class="pre">}</span></tt> (pound and curly
brace) characters. So, instead of using format strings:</p>
<div class="highlight-ruby">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">name1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Joe"</span> <span class="n">name2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Mary"</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hello %s, where is %s?"</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">name1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name2</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can type:</p>
<div class="highlight-ruby">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">name1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Joe"</span> <span class="n">name2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Mary"</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hello </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">name1</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">, where is </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">name2</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">?"</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We will now type in a whole bunch of strings, variables, formats, and
print them. You will also practice using short abbreviated variable
names. Programmers love saving themselves time at your expense by using
annoying cryptic variable names, so let's get you started being able to
read and write them early on.</p>
