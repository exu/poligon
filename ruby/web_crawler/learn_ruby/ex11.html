<h1>Exercise 11: Asking Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-11-asking-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>Now it is time to pick up the pace. I have got you doing a lot of
printing so that you get used to typing simple things, but those simple
things are fairly boring. What we want to do now is get data into your
programs. This is a little tricky because you have learn to do two
things that may not make sense right away, but trust me and do it
anyway. It will make sense in a few exercises.</p>
<p>Most of what software does is the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Take some kind of input from a person.</li>
<li>Change it.</li>
<li>Print out something to show how it changed.</li>
</ol>
<p>So far you have only been printing, but you haven't been able to get any
input from a person, or change it. You may not even know what "input"
means, so rather than talk about it, let's have you do some and see if
you get it. Next exercise we'll do more to explain it.</p>
