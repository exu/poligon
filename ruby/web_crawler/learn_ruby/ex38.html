<h1>Exercise 38: Reading Code<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-38-reading-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>Now go find some Ruby code to read. You should be reading any Ruby code
you can and trying to steal ideas that you find. You actually should
have enough knowledge to be able to read, but maybe not understand what
the code does. What I'm going to teach you in this lesson is how to
apply things you have learned to understand other people's code.</p>
<p>First, print out the code you want to understand. Yes, print it out,
because your eyes and brain are more used to reading paper than computer
screens. Make sure you only print a few pages at a time.</p>
<p>Second, go through your printout and take notes of the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Functions and what they do.</li>
<li>Where each variable is first given a value.</li>
<li>Any variables with the same names in different parts of the program.
These may be trouble later.</li>
<li>Any <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statements</span></tt> without <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">else</span></tt> clauses. Are they right?</li>
<li>Any <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">while-loops</span></tt> that might not end.</li>
<li>Finally, any parts of code that you can't understand for whatever
reason.</li>
</ol>
<p>Third, once you have all of this marked up, try to explain it to
yourself by writing comments as you go. Explain the functions, how they
are used, what variables are involved, anything you can to figure this
code out.</p>
<p>Lastly, on all of the difficult parts, trace the values of each variable
line by line, function by function. In fact, do another printout and
write in the margin the value of each variable that you need to "trace".</p>
<p>Once you have a good idea of what the code does, go back to the computer
and read it again to see if you find new things. Keep finding more code
and doing this until you do not need the printouts anymore.</p>

</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Find out what a "flow chart" is and write a few.</li>
<li>If you find errors in code you are reading, try to fix them and send
the author your changes.</li>
<li>Another technique for when you are not using paper is to put <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></tt>
comments with your notes in the code. Sometimes, these could become
the actual comments to help the next person.</li>
</ol>
