<h1>Exercise 52: The Start Of Your Web Game<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-52-the-start-of-your-web-game" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>We're coming to the end of the book, and in this exercise I'm going to
really challenge you. When you're done, you'll be a reasonably competent
Ruby beginner. You'll still need to go through a few more books and
write a couple more projects, but you'll have the skills to complete
them. The only thing in your way will be time, motivation, and
resources.</p>
<p>In this exercise, we won't make a complete game, but instead we'll make
an "engine" that can run the game from Exercise 42 in the browser. This
will involve refactoring Exercise 42, mixing in the structure from
Exercise 47, adding automated tests, and finally creating a web engine
that can run the games.</p>
<p>This exercise will be <em>huge</em>, and I predict you could spend anywhere
from a week to months on it before moving on. It's best to attack it in
little chunks and do a bit a night, taking your time to make everything
work before moving on.</p>

<h2>Refactoring The Exercise 42 Game<a class="headerlink" href="#refactoring-the-exercise-42-game" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>You've been altering the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gothonweb</span></tt> project for two exercises and
you'll do it one more time in this exercise. The skill you're learning
is called "refactoring", or as I like to call it, "fixing stuff".
Refactoring is a term programmers use to describe the process of taking
old code, and changing it to have new features or just to clean it up.
You've been doing this without even knowing it, as it's second nature to
building software.</p>
<p>What you'll do in this part is take the ideas from Exercise 47 of a
testable "map" of Rooms, and the game from Exercise 42, and combine them
together to create a new game structure. It will have the same content,
just "refactored" to have a better structure.</p>
<p>First step is to grab the code from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ex47.rb</span></tt> and copy it to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gothonweb/lib/map.rb</span></tt> and copy <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ex47_tests.rb</span></tt> file to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gothonweb/test/test_map.rb</span></tt> and run the test suite again to make sure
it keeps working.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">From now on I won't show you the output of a test run,
just assume that you should be doing it and it'll look like the
above unless you have an error.</p>
</div>
<p>Once you have the code from Exercise 47 copied over, it's time to
refactor it to have the Exercise 42 map in it. I'm going to start off by
laying down the basic structure, and then you'll have an assignment to
make the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">map.rb</span></tt> file and the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">map_tests.rb</span></tt> file complete.</p>
<p>First thing to do is lay out the basic structure of the map using the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Room</span></tt> class as it is now:</p>

<p>You'll notice that there are a couple of problems with our Room class
and this map:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>We have to put the text that was in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-else</span></tt> clauses that got
printed before entering a room as part of each room. This means you
can't shuffle the map around which would be nice. You'll be fixing
that up in this exercise.</li>
<li>There are parts in the original game where we ran code that
determined things like the bomb's keypad code, or the right pod. In
this game we just pick some defaults and go with it, but later you'll
be given extra credit to make this work again.</li>
<li>I've just made a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">generic_death</span></tt> ending for all of the bad
decisions, which you'll have to finish for me. You'll need to go back
through and add in all the original endings and make sure they work.</li>
<li>I've got a new kind of transition labeled <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"*"</span></tt> that will be used
for a "catch-all" action in the engine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you've got that basically written out, here's the new automated
test <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/test_map.rb</span></tt> that you should have to get yourself started:</p>

<p>Your task in this part of the exercise is to complete the map, and make
the automated test completely validate the whole map. This includes
fixing all the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">generic_death</span></tt> objects to be real endings. Make sure
this works really well and that your test is as complete as possible
because we'll be changing this map later and you'll use the tests to
make sure it keeps working.</p>

<p>At a certain point in your web application you'll need to keep track of
some information and associate it with the user's browser. The web
(because of HTTP) is what we like to call "stateless", which means each
request you make is independent of any other requests being made. If you
request page A, put in some data, and click a link to page B, all the
data you sent to page A just disappears.</p>
<p>The solution to this is to create a little data store (usually in a
database, on disk, or in cookies) that uses a number unique to each
browser to keep track of what that browser was doing. In Sinatra it's
fairly easy, and here's an example showing how it's done using Rack
middleware:</p>

<h2>Creating An Engine<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-an-engine" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>

<p>You should have your game map working and a good unit test for it. I now
want to make a simple little game engine that will run the rooms,
collect input from the player, and keep track of where a play is in the
game. We'll be using the sessions you just learned to make a simple game
engine that will:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Start a new game for new users.</li>
<li>Present the room to the user.</li>
<li>Take input from the user.</li>
<li>Run their input through the game.</li>
<li>Display the results and keep going until they die.</li>
</ol>
<p>To do this, you're going to take the trusty <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lib/gothonweb.rb</span></tt> you've
been hacking on and create a fully working, session based, game engine.
The catch is I'm going to make a very simple one with basic HTML files,
and it'll be up to you to complete it. Here's the base engine:</p>

<p>That is the template to show a room as you travel through the game. Next
you need one to tell someone they died in the case that they got to the

<li>Get the test <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/test_gothonweb.rb</span></tt> working again so that you are
testing the game. You won't be able to do much more than a few clicks
in the game because of sessions, but you should be able to do some
basics.</li>
<li>Run the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lib/gothonweb.rb</span></tt> script and test out the game.</li>
<li>You should be able to refresh and fix the game like normal, and work
with the game HTML and engine until it does all the things you want
it to do.</li>

<p>Do you feel like this was a huge amount of information thrown at you all
at once? Good, I want you to have something to tinker with while you
build your skills. To complete this exercise, I'm going to give you a
final set of exercises for you to complete on your own. You'll notice
that what you've written so far isn't very well built, it is just a
first version of the code. Your task now is to make the game more
complete by doing these things:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Fix all the bugs I mention in the code, and any that I didn't
mention. If you find new bugs, let me know.</li>
<li>Improve all of the automated tests so that you test more of the
application and get to a point where you use a test rather than your
browser to check the application while you work.</li>
<li>Make the HTML look better.</li>
<li>Research logins and create a signup system for the application, so
people can have logins and high scores.</li>
<li>Complete the game map, making it as large and feature complete as
possible.</li>
<li>Give people a "help" system that lets them ask what they can do at
each room in the game.</li>
<li>Add any other features you can think of to the game.</li>
<li>Create several "maps" and let people choose a game they want to run.
Your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lib/gothonweb.rb</span></tt> engine should be able to run any map of
rooms you give it, so you can support multiple games.</li>
<li>Finally, use what you learned in Exercises 48 and 49 to create a
better input processor. You have most of the code necessary, you just
need to improve the grammar and hook it up to your input form and the
GameEngine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck!</p>
