<h1>Exercise 44: Evaluating Your Game<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-44-evaluating-your-game" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>In this exercise you will evaluate the game you just made. Maybe you got
part-way through it and you got stuck. Maybe you got it working but just
barely. Either way, we're going to go through a bunch of things you
should know now and make sure you covered them in your game. We're going
to study how to properly format a class, common conventions in using
classes, and a lot of "textbook" knowledge.</p>
<p>Why would I have you try to do it yourself and then show you how to do
it right? From now on in the book I'm going to try to make you
self-sufficient. I've been holding your hand mostly this whole time, and
I can't do that for much longer. I'm now instead going to give you
things to do, have you do them on your own, and then give you ways to
improve what you did.</p>
<p>You will struggle at first and probably be very frustrated but stick
with it and eventually you will build a mind for solving problems. You
will start to find creative solutions to problems rather than just copy
solutions out of textbooks.</p>

<h2>Function Style<a class="headerlink" href="#function-style" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>All the other rules I've taught you about how to make a function nice
apply here, but add these things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>For various reasons, programmers call functions that are part of
classes <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">methods</span></tt>. It's mostly marketing but just be warned that
every time you say "function" they'll annoyingly correct you and say
"method". If they get too annoying, just ask them to demonstrate the
mathematical basis that determines how a "method" is different from a
"function" and they'll shut up.</li>
<li>When you work with classes much of your time is spent talking about
making the class "do things". Instead of naming your functions after
what the function does, instead name it as if it's a command you are
giving to the class. Same as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pop</span></tt> is saying "Hey array, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pop</span></tt>
this off." It isn't called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">remove_from_end_of_list</span></tt> because even
though that's what it does, that's not a command to an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">array</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Keep your functions small and simple. For some reason when people
start learning about classes they forget this.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="class-style">
<h2>Class Style<a class="headerlink" href="#class-style" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Your class should use "proper case" like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SuperGoldFactory</span></tt> rather
than <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">super_gold_factory</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Try not to do too much in your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">initialize</span></tt> functions. It makes
them harder to use.</li>
<li>Your other functions should use "underscore format" so write
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">my_awesome_hair</span></tt> and not <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myawesomehair</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MyAwesomeHair</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Be consistent in how you organize your function arguments. If your
class has to deal with users, dogs, and cats, keep that order
throughout unless it really doesn't make sense. If you have one
function takes (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dog</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cat</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">user</span></tt>) and the other takes
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">user</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cat</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dog</span></tt>), it'll be hard to use.</li>
<li>Try not to use variables that come from the module or globals. They
should be fairly self-contained.</li>
<li>A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. Consistency
is good, but foolishly following some idiotic mantra because everyone
else does is bad style. Think for yourself.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-style">
<h2>Code Style<a class="headerlink" href="#code-style" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Give your code vertical space so people can read it. You will find
some very bad programmers who are able to write reasonable code, but
who do not add any spaces. This is bad style in any language because
the human eye and brain use space and vertical alignment to scan and
separate visual elements. Not having space is the same as giving your
code an awesome camouflage paint job.</li>
<li>If you can't read it out loud, it's probably hard to read. If you are
having a problem making something easy to use, try reading it out
loud. Not only does this force you to slow down and really read it,
but it also helps you find difficult passages and things to change
for readability.</li>
<li>Try to do what other people are doing in Ruby until you find your own
style.</li>
<li>Once you find your own style, do not be a jerk about it. Working with
other people's code is part of being a programmer, and other people
have really bad taste. Trust me, you will probably have really bad
taste too and not even realize it.</li>
<li>If you find someone who writes code in a style you like, try writing
something that mimics their style.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="good-comments">
<h2>Good Comments<a class="headerlink" href="#good-comments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There are programmers who will tell you that your code should be
readable enough that you do not need comments. They'll then tell you
in their most official sounding voice that, "Ergo you should never
write comments." Those programmers are either consultants who get
paid more if other people can't use their code, or incompetents who
tend to never work with other people. Ignore them and write comments.</li>
<li>When you write comments, describe why you are doing what you are
doing. The code already says how, but why you did things the way you
did is more important.</li>
<li>When you write here doc dcomments for your functions, make the
comments documentation for someone who will have to use your code.
You do not have to go crazy, but a nice little sentence about what
someone does with that function helps a lot.</li>
<li>Finally, while comments are good, too many are bad, and you have to
maintain them. Keep your comments relatively short and to the point,
and if you change a function, review the comment to make sure it's
still correct.</li>
</ul>

<p>I want you now to pretend you are me. Adopt a very stern look, print out
your code, and take a red pen and mark every mistake you find. Anything
from this exercise and from other things you have known. Once you are
done marking your code up, I want you to fix everything you came up
with. Then repeat this a couple of times, looking for anything that
could be better. Use all the tricks I've given you to break your code
down into the smallest tiniest little analysis you can.</p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to train your attention to detail on
classes. Once you are done with this bit of code, find someone else's
code and do the same thing. Go through a printed copy of some part of it
and point out all the mistakes and style errors you find. Then fix it
and see if your fixes can be done without breaking their program.</p>
<p>I want you to do nothing but evaluate and fix code for the week. Your
own code and other people's. It'll be pretty hard work, but when you are
done your brain will be wired tight like a boxer's hands.</p>
