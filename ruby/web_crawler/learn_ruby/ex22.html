<h1>Exercise 22: What Do You Know So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-22-what-do-you-know-so-far" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>There won't be any code in this exercise or the next one, so there's no
WYSS or Extra Credit either. In fact, this exercise is like one giant
Extra Credit. I'm going to have you do a form of review what you have
learned so far.</p>
<p>First, go back through every exercise you have done so far and write
down every word and symbol (another name for 'character') that you have
used. Make sure your list of symbols is complete.</p>
<p>Next to each word or symbol, write its name and what it does. If you
can't find a name for a symbol in this book, then look for it online. If
you do not know what a word or symbol does, then go read about it again
and try using it in some code.</p>
<p>You may run into a few things you just can't find out or know, so just
keep those on the list and be ready to look them up when you find them.</p>
<p>Once you have your list, spend a few days rewriting the list and double
checking that it's correct. This may get boring but push through and
really nail it down.</p>
<p>Once you have memorized the list and what they do, then you should step
it up by writing out tables of symbols, their names, and what they do
from memory. When you hit some you can't recall <em>from memory</em>, go back
and memorize them again.</p>

"There is no failure, only trying."</p>

<p>It's important when you are doing a boring mindless memorization
exercise like this to know why. It helps you focus on a goal and know
the purpose of all your efforts.</p>
<p>In this exercise you are learning the names of symbols so that you can
read source code more easily. It's similar to learning the alphabet and
basic words of English, except that Ruby's alphabet has extra symbols
you might not know.</p>
<p>Just take it slow and do not hurt your brain. Hopefully by now these
symbols are natural for you so this isn't a big effort. It's best to
take 15 minutes at a time with your list and then take a break. Giving
your brain a rest will help you learn faster with less frustration.</p>
