<h1>Exercise 5: More Variables And Printing<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-5-more-variables-and-printing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>Now we'll do even more typing of variables and printing them out. This
time we'll use something called a "format string". Every time you put
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"</span></tt> (double-quotes) around a piece of text you have been making a
string. A string is how you make something that your program might give
to a human. You print them, save them to files, send them to web
servers, all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Strings are really handy, so in this exercise you will learn how to make
strings that have variables embedded in them. You embed variables inside
a string by using specialized format sequences and then putting the
variables at the end with a special syntax that tells Ruby, "Hey, this
is a format string, put these variables in there."</p>
<p>As usual, just type this in even if you do not understand it and make it
exactly the same.</p>
