<h1>Exercise 32: Loops And Arrays<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-32-loops-and-arrays" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>You should now be able to do some programs that are much more
interesting. If you have been keeping up, you should realize that now
you can combine all the other things you have learned with
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statements</span></tt> and boolean expressions to make your programs do smart
things.</p>
<p>However, programs also need to do repetitive things very quickly. We are
going to use a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for-loop</span></tt> in this exercise to build and print various
arrays. When you do the exercise, you will start to figure out what they
are. I won't tell you right now. You have to figure it out.</p>
<p>Before you can use a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for-loop</span></tt>, you need a way to store the results
of loops somewhere. The best way to do this is with an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">array</span></tt>. An
array is a container of things that are organized in order. It's not
complicated; you just have to learn a new syntax. First, there's how you
make an array:</p>
<div class="highlight-ruby">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">hairs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">'brown'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'blond'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'red'</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="n">eyes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">'brown'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'blue'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'green'</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="n">weights</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>What you do is start the array with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[</span></tt> (left-bracket) which
"opens" the array. Then you put each item you want in the array
separated by commas, just like when you did function arguments. Lastly
you end the array with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">]</span></tt> (right-bracket) to indicate that it's
over. Ruby then takes this array and all its contents, and assigns them
to the variable.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">This is where things get tricky for people who can't
program. Your brain has been taught that the world is flat. Remember
in the last exercise where you put <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statements</span></tt> inside
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statements</span></tt>? That probably made your brain hurt because most
people do not ponder how to "nest" things inside things. In
programming this is all over the place. You will find functions that
call other functions that have <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if-statements</span></tt> that have arrays
with arrays inside arrays. If you see a structure like this that you
can't figure out, take out pencil and paper and break it down
manually bit by bit until you understand it.</p>
</div>
<p>We now will build some arrays using some loops and print them out:</p>

<td class="code">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">the_count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="n">fruits</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">'apples'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'oranges'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'pears'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'apricots'</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="n">change</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'pennies'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'dimes'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'quarters'</span><span class="o">]</span>

<span class="c1"># this first kind of for-loop goes through an array</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">the_count</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"This is count </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1"># same as above, but using a block instead</span>
<span class="n">fruits</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">fruit</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"A fruit of type: </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">fruit</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1"># also we can go through mixed arrays too</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">change</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"I got </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1"># we can also build arrays, first start with an empty one</span>
<span class="n">elements</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[]</span> 

<span class="c1"># then use a range object to do 0 to 5 counts</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Adding </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> to the list."</span>
  <span class="c1"># push is a function that arrays understand</span>
  <span class="n">elements</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1"># now we can puts them out too</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">elements</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Element was: </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
