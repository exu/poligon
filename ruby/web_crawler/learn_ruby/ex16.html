<h1>Exercise 16: Reading And Writing Files<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-16-reading-and-writing-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>If you did the extra credit from the last exercise you should have seen
all sorts of commands (methods/functions) you can give to files. Here's
the list of commands I want you to remember:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>close -- Closes the file. Like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">File-&gt;Save..</span></tt> in your editor.</li>
<li>read -- Reads the contents of the file, you can assign the result to
a variable.</li>
<li>readline -- Reads just one line of a text file.</li>
<li>truncate -- Empties the file, watch out if you care about the file.</li>
<li>write(stuff) -- Writes stuff to the file.</li>
</ul>
<p>For now these are the important commands you need to know. Some of them
take parameters, but we do not really care about that. You only need to
remember that write takes a parameter of a string you want to write to
the file.</p>
<p>Let's use some of this to make a simple little text editor:</p>

<p>That's a large file, probably the largest you have typed in. So go slow,
do your checks, and make it run. One trick is to get bits of it running
at a time. Get lines 1-8 running, then 5 more, then a few more, etc.,
until it's all done and running.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-you-should-see">
<h2>What You Should See<a class="headerlink" href="#what-you-should-see" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>There are actually two things you will see, first the output of your new
script:</p>
<div class="highlight-console">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> ruby ex16.rb test.txt
<span class="go">We're going to erase 'test.txt'.</span>
<span class="go">If you don't want that, hit CTRL-C (^C).</span>
<span class="go">If you do want that, hit RETURN.</span>
<span class="go">?</span>
<span class="go">Opening the file...</span>
<span class="go">Truncating the file.  Goodbye!</span>
<span class="go">Now I'm going to ask you for three lines.</span>
<span class="go">line 1: To all the people out there.</span>
<span class="go">line 2: I say I don't like my hair.</span>
<span class="go">line 3: I need to shave it off.</span>
<span class="go">I'm going to write these to the file.</span>
<span class="go">And finally, we close it.</span>
<span class="gp">$</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now, open up the file you made (in my case test.txt) in your editor and
check it out. Neat right?</p>

<h2>Extra Credit<a class="headerlink" href="#extra-credit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>If you feel you do not understand this, go back through and use the
comment trick to get it squared away in your mind. One simple English
comment above each line will help you understand, or at least let you
know what you need to research more.</li>
<li>Write a script similar to the last exercise that uses read and argv
to read the file you just created.</li>
<li>There's too much repetition in this file. Use strings, formats, and
escapes to print out line1, line2, and line3 with just one
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">target.write()</span></tt> command instead of 6.</li>
<li>Find out why we had to pass a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'w'</span></tt> as an extra parameter to open.
Hint: open tries to be safe by making you explicitly say you want to
write a file.</li>
<li>If you open the file with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'w'</span></tt> mode, then do you really need the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">target.truncate()</span></tt>? Go read the docs for Ruby's <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">File.open</span></tt>
function and see if that's true.</li>
