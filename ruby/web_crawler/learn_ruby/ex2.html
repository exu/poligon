<h1>Exercise 2: Comments And Pound Characters<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-2-comments-and-pound-characters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h1>
<p>Comments are very important in your programs. They are used to tell you
what something does in English, and they also are used to disable parts
of your program if you need to remove them temporarily. Here's how you
use comments in Ruby:</p>
<div class="highlight-ruby"><table class="highlighttable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1"># A comment, this is so you can read your program later.</span>
<span class="c1"># Anything after the # is ignored by Ruby.</span>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"I could have code like this."</span> <span class="c1"># and the comment after is ignored</span>

<span class="c1"># You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:</span>
<span class="c1"># print "This won't run."</span>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"This will run."</span>
</pre></div>

<li>Find out if you were right about what the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></tt> character does and
make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).</li>
<li>Take your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ex2.rb</span></tt> file and review each line going backwards. Start
at the last line, and check each word in reverse against what you
should have typed.</li>
<li>Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.</li>
<li>Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character
by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.</li>
