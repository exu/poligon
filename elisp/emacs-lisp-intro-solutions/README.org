#+AUTHOR: Ren Wenshan <renws1990@gmail.com>

`An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp' (elisp intro) is a manual that
comes with Emacs for programming beginners. This is my review of Elisp Intro:
http://wenshanren.org/?p=217

In Emacs, press =M-x info=, then search for "Emacs Lisp Intro", now you should
be able to read it by simply clicking the result that is found by Emacs. The
benefits of reading this manual in Emacs are:

- Operations such navigation, searching, adding bookmarks and so on are very
  convenient.
- You can run the examples in the book when you read it, which is super handy.


This repository is a collection of my solutions to the exercises in the `elisp
intro', including:

*Note*:
- Chapter 14 and chapter 16 do not have exercises.
- The exercises in chapter 17 are not programming tasks, you can finish them by
  following the questions.


I am just a beginner of elisp, and my poor English skills might caused some
misunderstanding of the exercises. Please feel free to point out any mistakes
you might find.

Happy Hacking!
